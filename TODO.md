# TODO
- Links - would be nice to click on links to go to details, but not enough time
- Might want to break up the search bar in the Master View into a child view controller
- Localization not handled.
- A few force unwraps, although in all places, I would want the app to fail if nil for quick identification
- Paging on demand rather than preloading everything but since data set is small and time is limited, decided to load all
- Only tested on large phones and ipad, there may be layout issues on smaller devices.
- Works best on ipad or mac catalyst
- General UI cleanup
- Add a activity spinner for longer loads.
- More test coverage.
- An interlock to prevent more than one search queued up from fast cliicking in UI.
- Did not do species, ran out of space in search bar
- more error handling and checking for errors.
